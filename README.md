# Conceptualizing Surprise with the Jensen–Shannon distance: A Bayesian Information-Theoretic Approach for the Social Sciences

*Emil Niclas Meyer-Hansen*

2026-02-01

A formal (re)conceptualization of surprise is developed by the author for the social sciences in the research paper *Conceptualizing Surprise with the Jensen–Shannon distance: A Bayesian Information-Theoretic approach for the Social Sciences* (see the Abstract below). With still unfinished sections, the paper is currently very much a work-in-progress. It subscribes to the [*open science standard*](https://www.cos.io/open-science), is partly licensed under the CC BY 4.0 and partly under the GPL-3.0 (see the License below), and it is made freely available in PDF-format.

## Abstract

Generally in the social sciences, results are informally deemed surprising if their associated 𝑝-value is sufficiently small. This implicit interpretation, however, is both conceptually and mathematically inappropriate, and such misuse of the 𝑝-value can lead to erroneous conclusions about the novelty of results. To solve that issue, this paper builds on Bayesian inference, Information theory, and recommendations made to related fields, to argue for the adoption of a more appropriate conceptualization of surprise as the relative entropy between prior and posterior knowledge. This formal conceptualization enables researchers to appropriately measure surprise as the Jensen-Shannon divergence, for which the paper provides easily implementable software and a demonstration of its use in relation to empirical data.[©](#license)
